# idris2-sop
Idris port of Haskell's [sop-core](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/sop-core)
and [generic-sop](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/generics-sop) libraries.

This is still very much work in progress. However, some core functionality
should already be ready to use.

## Documentation
My goal for this library is that it should be well-documented. I'm not there yet,
but parts of the source code already contain proper doc comments.
There is also a separate documentation package located in `src/Doc`, which
can be type checked via `sop-docs.ipkg`.
For a lengthy tutorial about the core ideas behind all of this,
[start here](src/Doc/Intro.md).
